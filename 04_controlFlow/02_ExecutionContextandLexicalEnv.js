//Execution context means jabhi bhi hum apna function chalayenge function apna ek khud ka imaginary container banayega which will have 3 things:
// variable, function inside the parent function and lexical env of that function
//ye jo imaginary container hai we call that container execution context

//Lexical Environment- ek chart hota hai jisme likha hota hai ki aapka particular function kin cheezo ko access kar sakhta hai and kinko nahi, matlab it holds scope and scope chain
